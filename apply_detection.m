% APPLY DETECTION - apply detection result to extract DOA solutions
% S = apply_detection(S,em,method) %tf)
%
% Reform a DOA struct (containing Radial Data from a single time period)
% to keep only the DOA solutions that pass the given test (GLRT, SeaSonde,
% MUSIC-highest, etc.). 
% 
% INPUT
% S  - DOA struct with LR field and subfields for DOA methods (eg. MU, ML)
% em - col vector giving the number of emitters in each row of the DOA
%      struct
% tf - boolean true if detection threshold was met (em might contain a
%      a value for the number of emitters even if threshold was not met)?
%
% method = char string for documenting the method used
%
% written for GLRT with the eye toward a general use case, eg any data with
% the same format (boolean) could be used to reshape the DOA data
%
% EXAMPLES
%     % compute emitters
%     [em,~] = compute_emitters_from_lr(LR,cut(i));
%     
%     % apply detection
%     D = apply_detection(S,em,'glrt'); 
%
%     % get SeaSonde detection
%      S = detection_codar_post_proc(S,APM);
% 
%     % run for seasonde
%     U = apply_detection(S,S.Dual+1,'seasonde'); 
%
% where cut appears to be 25 for the SS, and 300 for lera
%

% SEE ALSO
% compute_emitters_from_lr.m, detection_codar_post_proc.m

% TO DO
% ... need to compare these and make sure they get the same thing ...
% eg: D = apply_detection(S,S.Dual+1);
%  and apply_test_result.m which works for the M=3 case (e.g. SeaSonde)
% 
% detection_codar_post_proc.m ...

% TO DO
% want to be able to vary the LR threshold ... 
%
% Need to be able to have within the struct different detection results, eg
% this applies only to MU or ML, etc ...

% check if we're running the test

% create a cell array that maps the number of emitters to the columns of
% the DOA matricies
cols = doa_column_index(5);




% Create a boolean array to use to extract the data we want to keep based
% on the determined number of emitters.

% allocate the boolean
tf = false(size(S.RadVel));

% populate the ones to keep with 'true'. This uses the number of emitters
% in 'em' to get the column index. Handle the odd case where we have NaN
% emitters (or zero). This passes them through as all false, which gets
% handled appropriately by the logical indexing below.

    if ~isnan(em(i)) & em(i)~=0
        tf(i,cols{em(i)}) = true;
    end
    
end



% Apply the boolean to struct field elements 

% apply to top level fields

% SPECIAL CASE HANDLING

% contains results from a single Doppler bin
%
% ... maybe just define a col function for everything ...

% -- STATUS --
% REGARDING ATTEMPT TO KEEP LR VALUES ...
% I'm going to consider this for now as a deep dive into the weeds, that is
% tangent to the main focus of the paper. Tangent, but important, but let's
% make sure the main focus gets taken care of first BE 4/4/2019
% 
% 
% % KEEP LR VALUES
% % might need to check this more carefully since this is being done at
% % about 50% mental capacity ...
% %
% % ... I think what I am doing is getting the vector eg from the LR matrix
% % that only contains the LR values that were used ... then expanding this
% % into a matrix that can be used with tf (in the same way the single col
% % data is above), then applying tf ...
% %
% % these are #rows by cols= emitter number ... seems to work for cell also
% fn = {'LR','GM','LR2','Rm'};
% 
% % REDUCE 
% % This makes the single column equivalent
% 
% % convert the row and column index implied by em into an absolute index
% ix = sub2ind(size(S.LR.ML),(1:length(em))',em);
% 
% for i = 1:numel(fn)
%     D.(fn{i}) = apply_to_substruct(S.(fn{i}),ix);

% 
% % Save number of emitters ... use single column treatment method, sort of
% Em = repmat(em,1,size(S.LR.ML,2));
% 
% D.Em = Em(ix);
% 
% % Now expand this to column size that the tf can be applied to ...
% 
% % dummy variable, created from the D struct data from above
% dm = repmat(D.Em,1,size(tf,2));
% 
% D.Em = dm(tf);

% logical indexing *ALWAYS* turns matricies into column vectors, and
% produces a vector the same orientation as it starts with.
