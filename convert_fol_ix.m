function peakIdx = convert_fol_ix(FOregi)
% CONVERT FOL IX - convert output of ImageFOLs to cell based format
%
% INTPUT
% FORegi -- The range/Doppler velocity indices of all points marked as
%           First Order (FO) in a cross spectra data matrix (sized 
%           number of range cells by FFT length). 
%
% OUTPUT
% peakIdx - A cell array (with numel = (# range cells)), each containing the
%           row index points within the First Order peaks.
%
% OUTPUT
% peakIdx - one range cell per cell index, each containing an array of the
% indecies of the first order
